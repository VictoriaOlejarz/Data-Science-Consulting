# Data Science Consulting Project

## Description:
- This is a semester long project completed in my data science consulting class. This project aims to evaluate the reliability of 10 AirBeam3 sensors loaned from the EPA. The sensors measure PM2.5, temperature, and relative humidity, catering to both outdoor and indoor applications. They are battery-powered and require a Bluetooth connection to a cell phone using the AirCasting app. My group and I analyzed and interpreted data recorded by Loyola University Chicago's environmental science class using Airbeam3 sensors.
